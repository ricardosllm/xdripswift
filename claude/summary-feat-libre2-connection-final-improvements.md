# Final Libre 2 Connection Improvements Summary

## Key Improvements Made (2025-07-29)

### 1. Manufacturer Data Detection (NEW!)
- **Added**: Detection of Abbott manufacturer ID in BLE advertisements
- **Code**: Checks for company ID 0x1F00 or 0x001F (Abbott)
- **Impact**: Can identify Libre 2 sensors even without name advertisement

### 2. Enhanced iPhone Disconnection
- **Added**: Force disconnect with peripheral reference clearing
- **Added**: Verification of disconnection status
- **Added**: Extended wait time (3 seconds) for proper disconnection
- **Impact**: Ensures iPhone fully releases BLE connection

### 3. Improved Logging
- **Added**: Detailed scan start logging
- **Added**: Manufacturer data hex logging
- **Added**: Connection state verification logs
- **Impact**: Better debugging information

### 4. Data Extension Integration
- **Fixed**: Resolved hexEncodedString() duplicate
- **Added**: Proper Data.swift extension to Watch App
- **Impact**: Consistent hex string handling

## Code Changes

### WatchBluetoothManager.swift
```swift
// New manufacturer data check
if let manufacturerData = advertisementData[CBAdvertisementDataManufacturerDataKey] as? Data,
   manufacturerData.count >= 8 {
    let companyID = manufacturerData[0..<2].withUnsafeBytes { $0.load(as: UInt16.self) }
    if companyID == 0x1F00 || companyID == 0x001F { // Abbott
        logger.info("Found device with Abbott manufacturer data!")
        // Connect immediately
    }
}
```

### BluetoothPeripheralManager.swift
```swift
// Enhanced disconnection
transmitter.disconnect()
if let peripheral = transmitter.peripheral {
    transmitter.centralManager?.cancelPeripheralConnection(peripheral)
}
transmitter.peripheral = nil
```

## What This Solves

### The Core Issue
Libre 2 sensors were not being detected because:
1. They often don't advertise their name
2. They don't always advertise the FDE3 service UUID
3. They may only advertise manufacturer data

### Our Solution
1. Check manufacturer data for Abbott ID
2. Ensure complete iPhone disconnection
3. Better logging for debugging

## Testing Instructions

1. Start handover process on iPhone
2. Watch for these logs:
   - "Disconnecting iPhone from Libre 2"
   - "Connection status after disconnect: 0" (0 = disconnected)
   - "Found device with Abbott manufacturer data!"
3. Connection should succeed within 30-60 seconds

## Next Steps If Still Issues

1. **Verify NFC Activation**: Ensure NFC scan actually activates BLE
2. **Check Timing**: May need to start Watch scan BEFORE NFC
3. **Monitor iPhone State**: Use BluetoothPeripheralManager+Libre2Watch methods to verify

## Build Status
- ✅ Watch App builds successfully
- ✅ iPhone app builds successfully
- ⚠️ Minor warnings about unused variables (non-critical)
