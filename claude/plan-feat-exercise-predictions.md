# Exercise-Aware Glucose Prediction System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance glucose predictions for Type 1 diabetics by incorporating exercise and activity data already available on iOS devices. By leveraging HealthKit, CoreMotion, and machine learning, we can significantly improve prediction accuracy and provide actionable insights for better glucose management.

## Background: Exercise Effects on Glucose

### Immediate Effects
- **Aerobic Exercise** (running, cycling): Generally decreases blood glucose during activity
- **Anaerobic Exercise** (sprinting, HIIT): Can cause temporary glucose spikes due to stress hormones
- **Resistance Training**: Mixed effects, often slight increase followed by prolonged sensitivity

### Delayed Effects
- **Increased Insulin Sensitivity**: Lasts 24-48 hours post-exercise
- **Delayed Hypoglycemia Risk**: Especially 4-8 hours post-exercise and overnight
- **Muscle Glucose Uptake**: Enhanced for glycogen replenishment

### Individual Variability Factors
- Fitness level and VO2 max
- Time of day
- Pre-exercise glucose levels
- Active insulin on board
- Recent food intake
