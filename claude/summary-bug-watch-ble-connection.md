# Summary: Watch BLE Connection Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Threading Issues (SwiftUI Publishing)
**Problem**: "Publishing changes from background threads is not allowed" warnings in Watch app console.

**Solution**: Wrapped all @Published property updates in `DispatchQueue.main.async` in `Libre2GlucoseManager.swift`:
```swift
// Update on main thread to avoid SwiftUI publishing errors
DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
    self?.sensorInfo = info
    self?.configureSensor(info)
    // ... rest of updates
}
```

### 2. BLE Scan Timeout Behavior
**Problem**: After scan timeout, BLE state was set to `.error`, preventing retry attempts.

**Solution**: Changed timeout behavior to set state to `.idle` instead of `.error`:
```swift
private func scanTimeout() {
    logger.warning("Scan timeout reached")
    stopScanning()
    connectionState = .idle  // Changed from .error
    lastError = WatchBluetoothError.scanTimeout
    arbitrationState = .watchDisconnected
}
```

### 3. Sensor Name Format Mismatch
**Problem**: Watch was searching for sensor with only last 6 characters of serial number, but Libre 2 sensors advertise as "ABBOTT" + full serial number.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `Libre2GlucoseManager` to pass full serial number instead of suffix(6)
- Enhanced `WatchBluetoothManager` discovery logic to properly match "ABBOTT" + serial format:

```swift
// Expected name format: "ABBOTT" + serial number
let expectedName = "ABBOTT\(targetSerial)"

// Check for exact match or if it contains ABBOTT with our serial
if name == expectedName || 
   (name.hasPrefix("ABBOTT") && name.contains(targetSerial)) ||
   name.contains(targetSerial) {
    logger.info("Found matching Libre 2 sensor!")
    // ... connect
}
```

### 4. Added Manual BLE Scan Debug Button
**Problem**: Hard to debug BLE connection issues without manual control.

**Solution**: Added "Start BLE Scan" button in Watch debug settings that allows manual triggering of BLE scan with proper serial number.

### 5. Improved BLE Discovery Logging
**Problem**: Insufficient logging to diagnose why sensors weren't being discovered.

**Solution**: Added detailed logging throughout the discovery process:
- Log all discovered peripherals with names and advertisement data
- Log expected vs actual sensor names
- Log when devices advertise the correct service UUID (FDE3)

## Testing Steps

1. Ensure iPhone is connected to Libre 2 sensor
2. Open Watch app and go to Libre 2 Direct settings
3. Verify sensor data is displayed (serial number, age, etc.)
4. Use "Start BLE Scan" button to manually trigger scan
5. Check console logs for discovery process:
   - Should see "Starting scan for sensor with full serial: 3MH01CEKWG0"
   - Should see discovered peripherals with names like "ABBOTT3MH01CEKWG0"
   - Should see "Found matching Libre 2 sensor!" when correct device is found

## Key Changes Summary

1. Fixed threading issues by ensuring UI updates happen on main thread
2. Changed error states to idle states to allow retry
3. Fixed sensor name format to match "ABBOTT" + full serial number
4. Added 2-second delay before scanning to give iPhone time to disconnect
5. Enhanced peripheral discovery with multiple matching strategies
6. Added manual debug controls for testing BLE connection
7. Improved logging throughout the BLE connection process

## Current Status

- Sensor data successfully syncs from iPhone to Watch ✅
- Threading issues resolved ✅
- BLE discovery logic updated to match correct sensor name format ✅
- Manual debug controls added for easier testing ✅
- Build succeeds without errors ✅

## Next Steps

The user should test the updated code to verify if the BLE connection now succeeds. The enhanced logging will help diagnose any remaining issues if the sensor is still not discovered.
