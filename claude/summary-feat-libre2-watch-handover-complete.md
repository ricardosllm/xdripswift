# Complete Libre 2 Watch Handover Implementation Summary

## Critical Insight from User
The user correctly identified that **fresh sensor data from NFC scan must be sent to the Watch** before it attempts to connect. The NFC scan provides potentially rotated security keys and updated sensor information that the Watch needs for successful connection.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Manufacturer Data Detection
- Added detection for Abbott manufacturer ID (0x1F00/0x001F) in BLE advertisements
- Can now identify Libre 2 sensors even when they don't advertise their name
- Located in: `WatchBluetoothManager.swift`

### 2. Enhanced iPhone Disconnection
- Force disconnect with verification
- Extended wait time (3 seconds) for proper disconnection
- Connection status logging after disconnect
- Located in: `BluetoothPeripheralManager.swift`

### 3. Fresh Sensor Data Sharing (CRITICAL)
- **Added notification system to share sensor data after NFC scan**
- Posts `libre2ShouldShareSensorDataWithWatch` notification after NFC completes
- RootViewController handles notification and calls `watchManager.shareCurrentLibre2SensorData()`
- 1-second delay after data sharing before proceeding with handover
- Located in: `BluetoothPeripheralManager.swift` and `RootViewController.swift`

### 4. Improved BLE Discovery
- Connects to ALL unnamed devices (no RSSI filtering)
- Parallel connection attempts
- Extended timeout (60 seconds)
- Retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- Located in: `WatchBluetoothManager.swift`

### 5. Better Logging
- Detailed manufacturer data logging
- Connection state verification
- Sensor data transmission confirmation
- Located in: Multiple files

## The Complete Handover Flow

1. **User initiates handover** in iPhone settings
2. **iPhone disconnects** from Libre 2 sensor (verified)
3. **NFC scan activated** to enable BLE advertising
4. **Fresh sensor data sent to Watch** (NEW - critical step!)
5. **Watch receives sensor data** including:
   - Sensor UID
   - Patch info
   - Serial number
   - Activation date
   - Unlock code (potentially rotated)
6. **Watch starts BLE scan** with updated sensor info
7. **Watch identifies sensor** using:
   - Name matching (ABBOTT + serial)
   - Manufacturer data (Abbott ID)
   - Service UUID (FDE3)
8. **Connection established** within 5-minute window

## Code Changes Summary

### BluetoothPeripheralManager.swift
```swift
// After NFC scan completes:
NotificationCenter.default.post(
    name: Notification.Name("libre2ShouldShareSensorDataWithWatch"),
    object: nil
)

// Delay before proceeding:
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1.0) {
    NotificationCenter.default.post(
        name: Notification.Name("libre2NFCScanCompleted"),
        object: nil,
        userInfo: ["success": true, "activationTime": Date()]
    )
}
```

### RootViewController.swift
```swift
// In viewDidLoad:
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    self,
    selector: #selector(handleLibre2ShouldShareSensorData),
    name: Notification.Name("libre2ShouldShareSensorDataWithWatch"),
    object: nil
)

// Handler method:
@objc private func handleLibre2ShouldShareSensorData() {
    trace("Sharing Libre 2 sensor data with Watch after NFC scan", log: log, category: ConstantsLog.categoryRootView, type: .info)
    watchManager?.shareCurrentLibre2SensorData()
}
```

### WatchBluetoothManager.swift
```swift
// Check manufacturer data:
if let manufacturerData = advertisementData[CBAdvertisementDataManufacturerDataKey] as? Data,
   manufacturerData.count >= 8 {
    let companyID = manufacturerData[0..<2].withUnsafeBytes { $0.load(as: UInt16.self) }
    if companyID == 0x1F00 || companyID == 0x001F { // Abbott
        logger.info("Found device with Abbott manufacturer data!")
        // Connect immediately
    }
}
```

## Testing the Complete Flow

1. **Start handover** on iPhone
2. **Watch for logs**:
   - "Disconnecting iPhone from Libre 2"
   - "Connection status after disconnect: 0"
   - "Sending fresh sensor data to Watch after NFC scan"
   - "Found libre2SensorData in message" (on Watch)
   - "Found device with Abbott manufacturer data!" (on Watch)
3. **Connection should succeed** within 30-60 seconds

## Why This Works

The key insight was that Libre 2 sensors may rotate their security credentials during NFC activation. By sending the fresh sensor data to the Watch immediately after NFC scan, we ensure the Watch has the correct unlock code and other parameters needed for successful connection.
