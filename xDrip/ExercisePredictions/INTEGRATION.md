# Exercise Predictions - Integration Guide

## Current Status

We've implemented the foundation for exercise-aware predictions with complete backwards compatibility:

### ✅ Completed in this session:

1. **Feature Flags** (`UserDefaults+Exercise.swift`)
   - Master toggle for exercise predictions
   - Granular control over sub-features
   - Safe bounds checking for settings
   - Reset functionality

2. **HealthKit Manager** (`ExerciseHealthKitManager.swift`)
   - Singleton pattern for health data access
   - Privacy-first authorization flow
   - Only requests read permissions
   - Handles authorization state properly

3. **Settings Integration Pattern** 
   - Extension-based approach to add settings
   - No modifications to existing code
   - Shows both extension and subclass patterns

4. **Test Suite** (`ExercisePredictionsTests.swift`)
   - Feature flag tests
   - Backwards compatibility tests
   - Settings boundary tests
   - Reset functionality tests

## Next Steps - Xcode Project Integration

### 1. Add Files to Xcode Project

Open `xdrip.xcodeproj` and add the following files:

**Create New Group: "ExercisePredictions"**
- Location: Under the main "xdrip" group
- Add folders:
  - `DataCollection`
  - `Analysis` 
  - `Models`
  - `UI`

**Add Files to Groups:**
- `DataCollection/ExerciseHealthKitManager.swift`
- `UI/ExerciseSettingsIntegration.swift`
- `README.md`
- `INTEGRATION.md`

**Add Extensions:**
- `Extensions/UserDefaults+Exercise.swift`
- `Extensions/SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel+Exercise.swift`

**Add Tests:**
- `Tests/ExercisePredictionsTests.swift`

### 2. Enable HealthKit Capability

1. Select the xdrip target
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Click "+" to add capability
4. Add "HealthKit"
5. Check "Clinical Health Records" (unchecked)
6. Check "Background Delivery" ✓

### 3. Add to Info.plist

Add these keys to explain why we need health data:

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>xDrip4iOS can use your activity and workout data to improve glucose predictions. All data processing happens on your device.</string>

<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>xDrip4iOS does not write any data to Apple Health.</string>
```

### 4. Minimal Code Integration

To actually show the exercise settings in Developer Settings, you have two options:

**Option A: Subclass Approach (Recommended)**

In `SettingsViewController.swift`, find where `SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel` is instantiated and replace with:

```swift
// Replace this:
let viewModel = SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel()

// With this:
let viewModel = UserDefaults.standard.exerciseFeaturesAvailable ? 
    ExerciseAwareDevelopmentSettingsViewModel() : 
    SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel()
```

**Option B: Factory Pattern**

Create a factory method:

```swift
extension SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel {
    static func createInstance() -> SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel {
        if UserDefaults.standard.exerciseFeaturesAvailable {
            return ExerciseAwareDevelopmentSettingsViewModel()
        }
        return SettingsViewDevelopmentSettingsViewModel()
    }
}
```

### 5. Build and Test

1. Build the project: `Cmd+B`
2. Run tests: `Cmd+U`
3. Enable Developer Settings in the app
4. Look for "Exercise-Aware Predictions" toggle
5. Test enabling/disabling features

## Architecture Benefits

This implementation demonstrates several key benefits:

1. **Zero Breaking Changes** - All existing code continues to work
2. **Feature Flags** - Can be disabled instantly without code changes
3. **Modular Design** - Easy to remove entire feature if needed
4. **Testable** - Comprehensive test coverage from day one
5. **Privacy-First** - Clear user consent and local processing

## Future Implementation Phases

### Phase 2: Data Collection (Next)
- Implement background HealthKit observers
- Create Core Data models for activity data
- Build activity classification engine

### Phase 3: Analysis Engine
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Impact calculation models
- Correlation analysis

### Phase 4: Prediction Integration
- Enhance existing predictions
- Add confidence intervals
- Create UI visualizations

## Notes for Reviewers

- All new code is isolated in the `ExercisePredictions` folder
- No modifications to existing xDrip code
- Feature is completely opt-in via Developer Settings
- Comprehensive test coverage included
- Privacy-first design with clear user consent
