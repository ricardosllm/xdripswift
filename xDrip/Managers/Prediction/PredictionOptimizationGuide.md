# Glucose Prediction Algorithm Optimization Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines performance optimizations and implementation strategies for the improved glucose prediction algorithm in xDrip4iOS.

## Key Improvements Based on Research

### 1. **Multi-Model Ensemble Approach**
- **Trend-Based Model**: Adaptive trending with volatility-based damping
- **Pattern-Based Model**: Historical pattern matching with time-of-day awareness
- **Physiological Model**: Insulin and carbohydrate absorption curves
- **Ensemble Weighting**: Dynamic weight adjustment based on current conditions

### 2. **Performance Optimizations**

#### Memory Management
```swift
// Use sliding window for readings to limit memory usage
private let maxReadingsInMemory = 288 // 24 hours at 5-minute intervals

// Implement circular buffer for efficient data management
class CircularBuffer<T> {
    private var buffer: [T?]
    private var writeIndex = 0
    private let capacity: Int
    
    init(capacity: Int) {
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.buffer = Array(repeating: nil, count: capacity)
    }
    
    func append(_ element: T) {
        buffer[writeIndex % capacity] = element
        writeIndex += 1
    }
}
```

#### Computation Optimization
- **Vectorized Operations**: Use Accelerate framework for matrix operations
- **Caching**: Cache frequently computed values (trends, patterns)
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Only compute predictions when needed
- **Background Processing**: Offload heavy computations to background queue

### 3. **Accuracy Improvements**

#### Feature Engineering
- **Multi-scale Trends**: Short (30min), medium (2hr), long (6hr) term trends
- **Volatility Metrics**: Standard deviation of rate of change
- **Acceleration**: Second derivative for trend changes
- **Circadian Patterns**: Time-of-day specific behaviors

#### Treatment Modeling
- **Insulin Absorption**: Exponential decay models with personalized parameters
- **Carb Absorption**: Bi-exponential model for complex carbohydrates
- **Exercise Effects**: Increased insulin sensitivity modeling

### 4. **iOS-Specific Optimizations**

#### Core ML Integration
```swift
// Future enhancement: Use Core ML for pattern recognition
import CoreML

class MLPredictionModel {
    private let model: MLModel
    
    func predict(features: MLMultiArray) -> Double? {
        // Implement Core ML prediction
    }
}
```

#### Background Updates
```swift
// Implement background task for prediction updates
import BackgroundTasks

func schedulePredictionUpdate() {
    let request = BGProcessingTaskRequest(
        identifier: "com.xdrip.prediction.update"
    )
    request.requiresNetworkConnectivity = false
    request.requiresExternalPower = false
    
    try? BGTaskScheduler.shared.submit(request)
}
```
